      <h5>Bio</h5>
      <p>
        I received my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies in in 2010, followed by a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics in 2011 in Skopje, Macedonia. For my PhD studies I moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I started working at the Department of Knowledge Technologies at the Jožef Stefan Institute. For my thesis I developed methods for scientific knowledge discovery by modeling and design of deterministic and stochastic dynamical biological systems. Since 2016 I work as a research associate at the Jožef Stefan Institute.

        In 2018 I joined the Saez-Rodriguez group at the Heidelberg University, as a postdoctoral researcher, focusing on machine learning for modeling spatially resolved omics data. In 2022 I became a Research Area Leader, coordinating and overseeing the development and application of machine learning and optimization methods for analysis of spatial omics data within the institute. Since 2024 I am a leading the Computational Biomedical Discovery group.

      <h5>Research interests</h5>
      <p>
        My research interests are at the intersection of systems sciences and machine learning. I am interested in the development of methods that combine data and prior knowledge. I have a strong background in machine learning and experience in computational systems biology. I am experienced in modeling and design of dynamical systems and their application to problems coming from the domains of systems and synthetic biology. I am currently working on developing methods for analysis of highly multiplexed and spatially resolved data. I am keen to understand the different patterns of expression within the tissue and bridge them to the underlying dynamical mechanisms that can explain the emergent functional programs and organization.

      <p>
        I studied physics in the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 2017, I received a scholarship to study abroad at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen, Germany. It was during this time period when I started to specialise in Biophysics and Complex Systems and had the opportunity to write my thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Nonlinear Dynamics on the topic of self-organisation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. In 2019 I started a Master of Science in Nanobiophysics at the Technical University of Dresden and studied the translation between different mathematical modelling frameworks for cell motion. From 2021-2024, I was working as a Bioimage Analyst in a joint position between EMBL and GSK. Here I have been developing reusable workflows to study image-based spatial-omics data.
      </p>
      <h5>Research interests</h5>
      <p>
        I am currently interested in the biological insights from more downstream analysis of spatial data.

      <p>
       In 2019, I received my BSc in Molecular Biomedicine in Bonn, Germany, and pursued my master studies in Molecular Biosciences in Heidelberg, Germany. During this time, I focused on computational biology in translational biomedical research. I explored the field of single-cell transcriptomics as well as various deconvolution methods of bulk RNA sequencing data. I interned and worked at the DKFZ Heidelberg and at ETH Zurich. In my master thesis with the Schapiro lab, I assessed different spatial neighborhood analysis methods using in silico generated tissue data. In my PhD, my goal is to decipher the spatial architecture of liver tumors using highly multiplexed imaging. I conduct my PhD in the lab of Dr. Denis Schapiro and am co-supervised by Dr. Jovan Tanevski.
      </p>
      <h5>Research interests</h5>
      <p>
        My research is driven by understanding biological mechanisms in diseases, especially by leveraging spatial biology. I am fascinated by the vast amount of machine learning algorithms that can help us to achieve this goal. Therefore, I enjoy exploring and developing suitable computational methodologies to detect structural and functional units in tissue. Here, I understand the uniqueness of diseases and aim towards linking observations to prior knowledge about biological mechanisms or patient information.
